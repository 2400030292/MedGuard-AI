MediGuard AI is a smart hospital system that helps verify the quality of medicines, prevent fake drugs, and make the hospital supply chain safer.
The goal of the project is to give hospitals a simple and reliable way to check batches, scan medicine packages, and manage quarantined items — all in one place.

🌟 What the System Does
🔍 1. Scan & Verify Medicines

You can upload a document, image, QR code, or use your camera to scan a medicine package.
The system simulates AI verification, checks the details, extracts text, and shows whether the batch is genuine or suspicious.

📄 2. Shows Extracted Information

After scanning, the platform displays:

The text detected from the image

Verification results

Any issues found

Confidence score

Logs of all checks

🛡 3. Detects Fake or Risky Batches

If something looks unsafe:

The system marks it as failed

It can automatically move that batch into quarantine

Staff can take actions like Destroy, Retest, or Return to Vendor

🧑‍⚕ 4. Supports Multiple Hospital Roles

Each role has its own PIN login:

Admin

Pharmacist

Quality Officer

Nurse

Doctor

Every role sees only what they are allowed to access.

📊 5. Real-Time Dashboard

The dashboard shows:

Trust score

Pending batches

Quarantine count

Supplier performance

Alerts

Risk levels

Compliance charts

Everything updates live from the cloud.

📦 6. Medicine Directory

A built-in library shows:

Medicine name

Storage location

Stock level

Pharmacy shelf details

Manufacturer

Type

FDA data (when searched)

🗂 7. Digital Passport

Verified batches show a "medicine passport" with:

Event history

Manufacturing steps

Quality checks

Transport details

Location logs

⚡ Behind the Scenes (Simple Explanation)

The system uses cloud tools to save logs and sync quarantine items.

It simulates OCR (text reading), AI verification, and scanning animations.

It shows live updates without refreshing the page.

The camera can scan labels directly inside the browser.
